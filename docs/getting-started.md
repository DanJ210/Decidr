# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) and npm

## Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
dotnet run
```

The API starts on `https://localhost:5001` (or the port shown in the terminal).  
Swagger UI is available at `https://localhost:5001/swagger` in development.

## Running the Frontend (Development)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite starts a dev server (typically `http://localhost:5173`) and proxies `/api` requests to the backend.

## Running the Full Stack (Production Build)

The backend serves the compiled frontend as static files from `wwwroot`. To build and serve everything together:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Copy dist output into backend/wwwroot, then:
cd ../backend
dotnet run
```

The app is then fully accessible at the backend URL.

## Seed Data

The backend starts with two pre-seeded debate cases and five users (four Members, one Moderator). No database setup is required — all data lives in memory and resets on each restart.
